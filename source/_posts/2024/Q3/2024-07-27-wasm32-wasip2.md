# Rust project promote the wasm32-wasip2 target to Tier 2

The `wasm32-wasip2` target is an extension to `wasm32-wasip1` target, originally known as `wasm32-wasi`. It is the next evolution in the development of WASI (the WebAssembly System Interface) that uses the WebAssembly component model to allow for a standardized set of syscalls that are intended to empower WebAssembly binaries with native host capabilities. This target is **cross-compiled**. The target supports `std` fully.

On February 28, 2024, Rust [merged the tier 3 target `wasm32-wasip2`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/119616); on July 17, 2024, the [target `wasm32-wasip2` was promoted to tier 2](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/126967).

WASI has released two milestone versions, [**0.1**](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/main/legacy/preview1/docs.md) and [**0.2**](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/main/preview2/README.md). They correspond to Rust targets [`wasm32-wasip1`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support/wasm32-wasip1.html) and [`wasm32-wasip2`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support/wasm32-wasip2.html) respectively.

WASI Preview 2 represents a major milestone for WASI. It marks the moment when WASI has fully rebased on the **Wit IDL** and the **component model** type system and semantics, making it modular, fully virtualizable, and accessible to a wide variety of source languages.

WASI Preview 2 is also known as “WASI 0.2”, and corresponds to versions numbered `0.2.x` in Wit packages and related identifiers. It is also known as “WASIp2”, where the “p” stands for either “preview” or “point”.

WASI Preview 2 contains the following APIs:

| Proposal         | Versions |
| ---------------- | -------- |
| wasi-io          | 0.2.0 |
| wasi-clocks      | 0.2.0 |
| wasi-random      | 0.2.0 |
| wasi-filesystem  | 0.2.0 |
| wasi-sockets     | 0.2.0 |
| wasi-cli         | 0.2.0 |
| wasi-http        | 0.2.0 |

## What You Need

- ✓ `WASI SDK 23.0` or later
- ✓ `wasmtime 23.0.1` or later
- ⍻ `WasmEdge 0.14.0` or later (wasm32-wasip1 only)
- ⍻ `wasmer 4.3.5` or later (wasm32-wasip1 only)
- ⍻ `wasmi 0.36.0` or later (No binary packages, requires `rust 1.77.0` or newer to compile) (wasm32-wasip1 only)
- ⍻ `wazero 1.7.3` or later (wasm32-wasip1 only)
- ⍻ `WebAssembly Micro Runtime 2.1.1` or later (wasm32-wasip1 only)

## WASI SDK

Let's first use the classic **Hello World** program to test the each WASI implementation:

### hello.c

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
    fprintf(stdout, "Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

### wasm32-wasip1

Generate WASM files for target `wasm32-wasip1`:

```bash
# /opt/wasi-sdk-23/bin/clang -v -Wl,--version --target=wasm32-wasip1

# /opt/wasi-sdk-23/bin/clang --target=wasm32-wasip1 -o hello-p1.wasm hello.c

# file hello-p1.wasm
hello-p1.wasm: WebAssembly (wasm) binary module version 0x1 (MVP)
```

All 6 WASI implementations used in this article support the target `wasm32-wasip1`:

```bash
# wasmtime hello-p1.wasm
Hello, World!

# wasmedge hello-p1.wasm
Hello, World!

# wasmer hello-p1.wasm
Hello, World!

# wasmi_cli hello-p1.wasm
Hello, World!

# wazero run hello-p1.wasm
Hello, World!

# iwasm hello-p1.wasm
Hello, World!
```

### wasm32-wasip2

Generate WASM files for target `wasm32-wasip2`:

```bash
# /opt/wasi-sdk-23/bin/clang -v -Wl,--version --target=wasm32-wasip2

# /opt/wasi-sdk-23/bin/clang --target=wasm32-wasip2 -o hello-p2.wasm hello.c

# file hello-p2.wasm
hello-p2.wasm: WebAssembly (wasm) binary module version 0x1000d
```

#### wasmtime

Earlier versions of `wasmtime` would report an error:

```bash
# wasmtime hello-p2.wasm
Error: cannot execute a component without `--wasm component-model`
```

The new version of `wasmtime` has no problem:

```bash
# wasmtime hello-p1.wasm
Hello, World!
```

#### wasmedge

`wasmedge` runs with an error, requiring component model support to be enabled:

```bash
# wasmedge hello-p2.wasm
[error] loading failed: illegal opcode, Code: 0x117
[error]     This instruction or syntax requires enabling Component Model proposal
[error]     Bytecode offset: 0x00000004
[error]     At AST node: component
[error]     File name: "hello-p2.wasm"
```

In fact, it is still unsuccessful to enable support for the component model:

```bash
root@wsl2-leap:~# wasmedge --enable-component hello-p2.wasm
[warning] component model is enabled, this is experimental.
[warning] component model is an experimental proposal
[error] Might an invalid wasm file
[error] loading failed: magic header not detected, Code: 0x103
[error]     Bytecode offset: 0x000410a9
[error]     At AST node: component
[error]     At AST node: component
[error]     File name: "hello-p2.wasm"
```

#### wasmer

`wasmer` does not support **WASI 0.2** yet:

```bash
# wasmer run hello-p2.wasm
error: Unable to compile "hello-p2.wasm"
╰─▶ 1: compile error
```

#### wasmi

`wasmi` does not support **WASI 0.2** yet:

```bash
# wasmi_cli hello-p2.wasm
Error: failed to parse and validate Wasm module "hello-p2.wasm": unknown binary version: 0xd, note: the WebAssembly component model feature is not enabled (at offset 0x0)
```

#### wazero

`wazero` does not support **WASI 0.2** yet:

```bash
# wazero run hello-p2.wasm
error compiling wasm binary: invalid version header
```

#### WebAssembly Micro Runtime

**WebAssembly Micro Runtime** does not support WASI 0.2 yet:

```bash
# iwasm hello-p2.wasm
WASM module load failed: unknown binary version
```

## Rust

Let's test each WASI implementation with a **Rust** implementation of the classic **Hello World** program:

### hello.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World!");
}
```

### wasm32-wasip1

Generate WASM files for target `wasm32-wasip1`:

```bash
# rustc -v --target wasm32-wasip1 -o hello-p1.wasm hello.rs

# file hello-p1.wasm
hello-p1.wasm: WebAssembly (wasm) binary module version 0x1 (MVP)
```

All 6 WASI implementations used in this article support the target `wasm32-wasip1`:

```bash
# wasmtime hello-p1.wasm
Hello, World!

# wasmedge hello-p1.wasm
Hello, World!

# wasmer hello-p1.wasm
Hello, World!

# wasmi_cli hello-p1.wasm
Hello, World!

# wazero run hello-p1.wasm
Hello, World!

# iwasm hello-p1.wasm
Hello, World!
```

### wasm32-wasip2

Generate WASM files for target wasm32-wasip2:

```bash
# rustc -v --target wasm32-wasip1 -o hello-p1.wasm hello.rs

# file hello-p1.wasm
hello-p1.wasm: WebAssembly (wasm) binary module version 0x1 (MVP)
```

## Wrapping Up

The component model is expected to add `future` and `stream` keywords, which will provide integrated and composable `async` functionality. WASI Preview 3 is planned to be a major revision of the Preview 2 APIs using these new features in place of `wasi-io`'s streams and polling interfaces. It's also expected to incorporate lessons learned from implementation and user experience with Preview 2.

When Preview 3 is launched, implementations may continue to support Preview 2, either by implementing Preview 3 along side it, or by virtualizing (polyfilling) Preview 2 in terms of Preview 3.

The release criteria of Preview 3 will include that performance will be measured and addressed.
